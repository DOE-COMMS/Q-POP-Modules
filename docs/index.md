The core modules of Q-POP (**Q**uantum **P**hase-field **O**pen-source **P**ackage) aim to deliver flexible, scalable, and extendable phase-field solvers that will enable researchers to study quantum materials and phase transitions with ease. The software will be made open-source in three stages, with new physics capabilities added with release. The module for insulator-metal transitions (Q-POP-IMT) was the first to be released in April 2024. The superconductor and the dynamical phase-field modules will follow soon.
